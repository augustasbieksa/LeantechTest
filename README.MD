Landing page project: https://augustasbieksa.github.io/LeantechTest/

Technologies used:
Bootstrap framework for layout, responsive layout, navigation bar and for inquiry modal forms if a client wants to contact the website.
jQuery for smooth page scrolling, sticky navigation bar, self closing menu navigation bar(after a user clicks).
jQuery has also been used for modal forms to inform the client if the mandatory fields weren't filled. 

I insert data into mysql table through bootstrap modal by using PHP script with Ajax jquery. With Ajax request I can send the request to PHP script where it has the information to send to the "inquiries" table, created in a "leantech" database.

After a successfuly sending data to database the user is informed with another bootstrap modal form  pop up.

I have worked with a local database, so just in case I am also sending the exported database. The name of my created database is leantech, the name of table is inquiries. 

Thank You for your time.
